# QUESTPAUSE Sentinel

Network safety, moderation, conflict tracking, player report, and personality bot for the QUESTPAUSE Network.

## Principles

- No automatic punishment
- No automatic bans
- No automatic revoke
- No public accusations
- The bot detects, logs, alerts, and suggests — human admins decide

## Current Commands (Stage 4)

| Command | Description | Admin |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `/sentinel-status` | Display Sentinel bot status and stats | No |
| `/log-incident` | Log a new incident | Yes |
| `/player-history` | View incident history for a player | No |
| `/resolve-incident` | Resolve an open incident | Yes |

## Storage

Incident data is stored as JSON files under `src/storage/data/incidents.json`. The storage layer uses an abstract interface (`src/storage/storeInterface.js`) designed to be swapped for SQLite in a future stage without changing business logic.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Fill in your Discord credentials:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` — bot token from Discord Developer Portal
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` — application client ID
   - `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` — set to your dev server ID for fast guild command deployment (leave empty for global commands)
4. `npm run deploy-commands` — register slash commands with Discord
5. `npm start` — launch the bot

## Development Notes

- Use `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` in `.env` to deploy commands instantly to a specific guild during development (global registration can take up to an hour).
- JSON data files under `src/storage/data/` are gitignored and persist across restarts.
- Do not commit `.env` — it contains your bot token.
- For production deployment on Oracle VM, use PM2 (see `DEPLOY.md`).

## Future Planned Features

The following are planned but not yet active:
- Player reports
- Warnings
- Watchlist
- Serious keyword guard
- Admin alerts
- Game personas
- Trigger replies
- Ambient messages

## Deployment

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for Oracle VM deployment instructions using PM2.
